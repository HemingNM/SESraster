## Maintainer comments
* about reset to user's options()/par()
I removed one par() from the vignette. Thank you for spotting that.
The user's options()/par() are not changed anymore.

* The words in the following check error are author names. I was asked to add 
references in the description, so I don't know how to solve it.
"Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Gotelli (19:23)
  Laffan (21:14)"
