Description: Randomization of presence/absence species distribution raster data 
    with or without including spatial structure for calculating standardized effect
    sizes and testing null hypothesis.
    The spatially unstructured randomization algorithms are based on fixed-fixed
    algorithms for matrices (Gotelli 2000, <doi:10.2307/177478>).
    The spatially structured randomization algorithm is based on the preserved richness
    null model (Laffan & Crisp 2003, <doi:10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00875.x>).
