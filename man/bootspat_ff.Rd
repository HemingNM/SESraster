\description{
Randomizes a raster stack with fixed richness and species frequency of incidence.
Randomizations are based on frequencies (given or calculated from x)
and, optionally, a probability raster stack.
The probability raster stack controls the probability that a
given species is sampled in each cell raster. Frequency controls the number of cells
being sampled for each species.
}
\details{
The algorithm is based on the algorithm of Connor & Simberloff (1979).
It takes each species at a time and placed on Nj (species frequency of
incidence) randomly chosen sites (cells). The original algorithm randomly
chooses the sequence of species and fills sites (originally islands) until they
reach the observed species richness. However, as sites (cells) are filled with
species, some species do not have enough available sites to be placed, and
their sampled frequency is smaller than observed. Additionally, some sites cannot
be completely filled because duplicated species are not allowed in the same site.
Their solution was to increase the number of sites to place the species.
Here, we opted to order the sequence of species from the largest Nj to the
smallest. Also, the probability of occupying a site is given by cell
expected richness and on each round (i.e. species placement), the expected
richness of newly occupied sites is reduced. This ensures that there will be
available sites for all species and the randomized frequency of
incidence equals the observed frequency of incidence (Nj).
